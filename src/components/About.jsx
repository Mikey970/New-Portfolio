      <img className="aboutPhoto" src={Image} />
      <h4 className="aboutBody">Hello, my name is Mike Delucia,  I am a 21 year old software engineer from Long Island, NY. I have a passion for software design because I enjoy the ability to bring ideas into fruition. I love to collaborate, and will always find a way to persevere through any obstacles that come up along the journey. Before software engineering, I worked in the merchant service business. Which requires a good knowledge of customer service and problem solving skills. These past experiences and learned skills  helped me learn how to use technology to efficiently solve problems that may arise.
